      <p>I am basically surrounded by animals at all times. As I write this, cats are crawling over my lap, and cleaning each other. During my break from working on this assignment, I was at the Cleveland Kennel running with a dog. In my free time I'm either with my wife taking our dogs to a park, or playing videogames while the pups come around seeking attention.</p>

      <p>During the week I'm working at a vet clinic, but I applied for this program with hopes of changing my career. I enjoyed the coding that I have done in the past, with C++ and Visual Basic. I hope that I can succeed in this boot camp and make use of my new skills in 6 months.</p>
